  <h2>What is this demonstrating?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Books on the Web can be read offline</strong>—on flights, holidays, trains, etc.
    <li><strong>No special format; it’s just the Web</strong>—simply a normal set of Web pages; no separate packaging or archiving is needed for offline use
    <li><strong>No server trickery needed</strong>—publications can be hosted statically
    <li><strong>No heavy framework required, no render-blocking JavaScript in the way of content</strong>—so it is fast and simple to deploy
  </ul>
  <h2>How does this use Service Workers?</h2>
  <p>
  This Web publication uses a
  <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers>Service Worker</a>
  to intercept all network requests for its constituent resources, and to
  load them from a local cache rather than over the Internet. The end result
  for you as a user is
  <a href=https://lordzen.github.io/books-on-the-web/#seamless>a seamless reading experience even when you are offline</a>.
