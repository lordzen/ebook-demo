      WAS wakened&mdash;indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the
      sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the
      door-post&mdash;by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the
      wood:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Block house, ahoy!" it cried. "Here's the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound, yet my
      gladness was not without admixture. I remembered with confusion my
      insubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw where it had brought me&mdash;among
      what companions and surrounded by what dangers&mdash;I felt ashamed to
      look him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and when I
      ran to a loophole and looked out, I saw him standing, like Silver once
      before, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, doctor! Top o' the morning to you, sir!" cried Silver, broad awake
      and beaming with good nature in a moment. "Bright and early, to be sure;
      and it's the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.
      George, shake up your timbers, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the ship's
      side. All a-doin' well, your patients was&mdash;all well and merry."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his elbow
      and one hand upon the side of the log-house&mdash;quite the old John in
      voice, manner, and expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've quite a surprise for you too, sir," he continued. "We've a little
      stranger here&mdash;he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit
      and taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did, right alongside of
      John&mdash;stem to stem we was, all night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook,
      and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, "Not Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very same Jim as ever was," says Silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some
      seconds before he seemed able to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," he said at last, "duty first and pleasure afterwards, as you
      might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod
      to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no
      apprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these
      treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his patients
      as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet English
      family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on the men, for they behaved to him
      as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship's doctor and they
      still faithful hands before the mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're doing well, my friend," he said to the fellow with the bandaged
      head, "and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head
      must be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it? You're a pretty
      colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take that
      medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough," returned Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, you see, since I am mutineers' doctor, or prison doctor as I
      prefer to call it," says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, "I make it
      a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!) and
      the gallows."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dick don't feel well, sir," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't he?" replied the doctor. "Well, step up here, Dick, and let me see
      your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man's tongue is fit
      to frighten the French. Another fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there," said Morgan, "that comed of sp'iling Bibles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That comes&mdash;as you call it&mdash;of being arrant asses," retorted
      the doctor, "and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison,
      and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most probable&mdash;though
      of course it's only an opinion&mdash;that you'll all have the deuce to pay
      before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp in a bog, would you?
      Silver, I'm surprised at you. You're less of a fool than many, take you
      all round; but you don't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of
      the rules of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his
      prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity
      schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates&mdash;"well, that's
      done for today. And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy,
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering over some
      bad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the doctor's proposal he
      swung round with a deep flush and cried "No!" and swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver struck the barrel with his open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si-lence!" he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.
      "Doctor," he went on in his usual tones, "I was a-thinking of that,
      knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. We're all humbly grateful for
      your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and takes the drugs down
      like that much grog. And I take it I've found a way as'll suit all.
      Hawkins, will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman&mdash;for
      a young gentleman you are, although poor born&mdash;your word of honour
      not to slip your cable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I readily gave the pledge required.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, doctor," said Silver, "you just step outside o' that stockade, and
      once you're there I'll bring the boy down on the inside, and I reckon you
      can yarn through the spars. Good day to you, sir, and all our dooties to
      the squire and Cap'n Smollett."
    </p>
    <p>
      The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver's black looks had
      restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. Silver
      was roundly accused of playing double&mdash;of trying to make a separate
      peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and
      victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was
      doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not imagine
      how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man the rest were,
      and his last night's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their
      minds. He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it was
      necessary I should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart in their faces,
      asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were
      bound a-treasure-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by thunder!" he cried. "It's us must break the treaty when the time
      comes; and till then I'll gammon that doctor, if I have to ile his boots
      with brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch,
      with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced by
      his volubility rather than convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slow, lad, slow," he said. "They might round upon us in a twinkle of an
      eye if we was seen to hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the
      doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we
      were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll make a note of this here also, doctor," says he, "and the boy'll
      tell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you may
      lay to that. Doctor, when a man's steering as near the wind as me&mdash;playing
      chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like&mdash;you wouldn't
      think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? You'll please bear
      in mind it's not my life only now&mdash;it's that boy's into the bargain;
      and you'll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o' hope to go on, for
      the sake of mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his
      friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his
      voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, John, you're not afraid?" asked Dr. Livesey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor, I'm no coward; no, not I&mdash;not <i>so</i> much!" and he snapped his
      fingers. "If I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly, I've the
      shakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a true; I never seen
      a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more than
      you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside&mdash;see here&mdash;and
      leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a
      long stretch, is that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and
      there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round now
      and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the
      doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the
      sand between the fire&mdash;which they were busy rekindling&mdash;and the
      house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Jim," said the doctor sadly, "here you are. As you have brewed, so
      shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to
      blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain
      Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and
      couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I will own that I here began to weep. "Doctor," I said, "you might spare
      me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should
      have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe
      this, I can die&mdash;and I dare say I deserve it&mdash;but what I fear is
      torture. If they come to torture me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jim," the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, "Jim, I
      can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor," said I, "I passed my word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, I know," he cried. "We can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on
      my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I
      cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it like
      antelopes."
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      "No," I replied; "you know right well you wouldn't do the thing yourself&mdash;neither
      you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver trusted me; I
      passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not let me finish. If
      they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of where the ship is, for
      I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking, and she lies in North
      Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high water. At half tide she
      must be high and dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ship!" exclaimed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a kind of fate in this," he observed when I had done. "Every
      step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance that
      we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy.
      You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn&mdash;the best deed that ever
      you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and
      talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!" he
      cried. "Silver! I'll give you a piece of advice," he continued as the cook
      drew near again; "don't you be in any great hurry after that treasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't," said Silver. "I can only,
      asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that
      treasure; and you may lay to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Silver," replied the doctor, "if that is so, I'll go one step
      further: look out for squalls when you find it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Silver, "as between man and man, that's too much and too
      little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me
      that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding
      with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much.
      If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave
      the helm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the doctor musingly; "I've no right to say more; it's not my
      secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you. But I'll
      go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig
      sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of
      hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best
      to save you, short of perjury."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver's face was radiant. "You couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if
      you was my mother," he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's my first concession," added the doctor. "My second is a
      piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help,
      halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I
      speak at random. Good-bye, Jim."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to
      Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.
