  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
  In browsers supporting
  <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers>Service Workers</a>,
  in the
  <a href=../treasure-island/><i>Treasure Island</i> web book</a>
  and here, you'll see a checkbox enabling you to continue having a
  <a href=https://lordzen.github.io/books-on-the-web/#seamless>seamless reading experience even if you drop offline</a>.

  <p>
  After you check that box, you’ll see a message saying
  <i>Caching complete! This Web publication is now readable offline.</i>
  (For the <a href=../treasure-island/><i>Treasure Island</i> web book</a>,
  it may take a while for the message to appear, depending on the speed of
  your Internet connection—it needs to cache about 109MB of content).

  <p>
  But once that <i>…now readable offline</i> message appears, turn off your
  WiFi, remove your Ethernet cable, or put your phone into Airplane Mode, and
  you’ll still be able to continue reading this content, at the same
  URL—just as if you were still online.
